<h1 style="color:rgb(255, 143, 219); text-align: center; font-size:55px;">MY FAVORITE CLASSES THIS TRI</h1>
<ol>
    <li><p style="color: rgb(255, 143, 219); font-size: 30px;">Lit Class</p></li>
    <p style="text-align: left; color: rgb(255, 143, 219); font-size: 25px;">Ive always enjoyed lit class, I love reading and exploring new ways of writing and exploring my creative ability. 
Writing has always meant very much to me, coming from someone who has always had a diary and looked forward to writing everyday about my day. 
I have loved our new Lit Shop unit; it is giving us all so much more time to read as we are all dealing with other various after-school activities.</p>
    <li><p style="color: rgb(255, 143, 219); font-size: 30px;">Web Class</p></li>
    <p style="text-align: left; color: rgb(255, 143, 219); font-size: 25px;">Even though Web Design is a requirement for eighth grade students it has been so fun to try something new, 
I have never taken a course similar to this one before and its been so interesting learning so many new things about coding. I wasnt expecting to enjoy making a website very much,
but its so fun to customize and create something creative while still incorporating our in-class work.</p>
    <li><p style="text-align: left; color: rgb(255, 143, 219); font-size: 25px;">Digital Music Studio</p></li>
    <p style="text-align: left; color: rgb(255, 143, 219); font-size: 25px;">I wanted to try as many new classes as possible this year, I wasnt very sure about enjoying Digital Music Studio because I have never done much with music in the past, let alone digitally.
We use a website called Sound Trap which allows you to create songs and beats on your computer, while also using an extension plugged into our computer called a Midi Keyboard. 
At first, using a Midi Keyboard was confusing and I struggled to navigate which buttons did which and how to properly use it to add onto my music and beats without sounding choppy. </p>

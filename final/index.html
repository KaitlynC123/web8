<h2 style="color:rgb(255, 143, 219); text-align: center; font-size:50px;">THINGS I ENJOY</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><p style="color: rgb(255, 143, 219); font-size: 30px;">Music - collecting vinyls.</p></li>
        <p style="text-align: left; color: rgb(255, 143, 219); font-size: 25px;">I love listening to music, I am open to listening to all genres and enjoy 
expanding my music taste with new albums and songs. I collect vinyls and enjoy going to record stores. I have a big collection of music ranging from pasted down 
vinyls from my grandpa to the newest dropped albums of this year.</p>
        <li><p style="color: rgb(255, 143, 219); font-size: 30px;">Crafting - making art.</p></li>
        <p style="text-align: left; color: rgb(255, 143, 219); font-size: 25px;">Ive always liked to make art and have been making art since a very young age; my dad is 
very passionate about drawing and has been influenced heavily by my grandma, who has always been crafting 
and making new creative art pieces. I love spending my free time working on art pieces and being creative with my drawings. </p>
        <li><p style="color: rgb(255, 143, 219); font-size: 30px;">Sports - playing with friends.</p></li>
        <p style="text-align: left; color: rgb(255, 143, 219); font-size: 25px;">I love spending time playing sports and bonding with friends; I think sports are an amazing way of connecting with other people and making new friends. 
I have always been open to trying new sports and athletics. In fifth grade I tried ultimate frisbee, something I had never tried before or played. 
I had an amazing time and started so many friendships, which was a great opportunity to start my first year off at Eastside Prep. </p>

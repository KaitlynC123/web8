<ol>
    <li><p style="color: rgb(255, 143, 219); font-size: 30px;">Tv Show - New Girl</p></li>
    <p style="text-align: left; color: rgb(255, 143, 219); font-size: 25px;">I love watching TV shows, mostly ones that dont require much thinking. 
I like watching shows where I can just sit down and relax without feeling confused or struggling to follow the plotline, typically because I watch them after school when I have finished all my homework, 
and I usually dont want to think very much and let my brain rest for a while. My sister and I watch New Girl together after school every few days, I see it as a relaxing bonding moment. 
New Girl is a very funny and creative show with likable characters and funny moments.</p>
    <li><p style="color: rgb(255, 143, 219); font-size: 30px;">Band - Radiohead</p></li>
    <p style="text-align: left; color: rgb(255, 143, 219); font-size: 25px;">My favorite band is Radiohead. I have most of their albums on vinyl, 
and I listen to them often. I like Radiohead because they create such pretty songs, usually very sad ones. 
But still, such wonderfully made and enjoyable albums to listen to. </p>
    <li><p style="text-align: left; color: rgb(255, 143, 219); font-size: 25px;">Movie - Lego Batman</p></li>
    <p style="text-align: left; color: rgb(255, 143, 219); font-size: 25px;">My favorite Movie is probably Lego Batman. I have a lot of favorites, 
but Legos played a big part in my childhood, and I spent a lot of time making and building with them, which I still love doing. I was Batman for Halloween in 2023, 
which was very influenced by my love for Lego Batman movies, original Batman movies, and comics too. Lego Batman was something me and my brother always 
rewatched over and over until it drove my parents crazy. Despite it being made for a way younger audience 
I will forever and always cherish the movie. </p>
